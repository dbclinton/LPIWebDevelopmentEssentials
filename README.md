Here are all th code snippets from my Complete LPI Web Development Essentials Study Guide book and course

Free free to make use of any and all of the key HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js code snippets you find here. They're from my [The Complete LPI Web Development Essentials Exam Study Guide book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C7X2SJKZ) and from the [Udemy course of the same name](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-lpi-web-development-essentials-exam-study-guide/?referralCode=C92570BCBB38302A9257).

Just for the record, The Complete LPI Web Development Essentials Exam Study Guide (in both book and course form) exists to quickly get you up to speed on all the core web development technologies: HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), JavaScript, Express.js, and Node.js. That means that, once you're done here, there should be nothing stopping you from taking and passing the LPI Web Development Essentials exam.

But what's much more important is that you'll have a working familiarity with all the tools you'll need to build efficient, secure, responsive, and interactive websites. 

Will you be a galaxy-level expert in any one of those tools? No, not yet, at least. But you'll know how to build the server environments it'll take to create those sites - and you'll know how to learn the details you'll need to build just about anything.

I don't think there's any software certification quite like this one. The LPIÂ has come up with a set of objectives that beautifully covers the up-to-date, real-world tool kit people are using to create real web applications and websites. These tools will make you better at just about anything else you're doing at work. And there's a great chance it'll push you to the next level(s) of your career!
