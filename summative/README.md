Once you've successfully worked through all the examples in my LPI Web Developement Essentials book or course, you should try to put all your new skills together in a single project. Consider building a task manager that uses an HTML form with JavaScript and Node.js to allow users to add, delete, or modify tasks that will be saved to a SQLite database.
When you've got your own site working (or in the unlikely event you give up), take a look at the working code here.
And do share your experiences!
Good luck.
